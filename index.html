    <p>I find Marie Curie so fascinating because she was truly a woman ahead of her time. I believe she helped path the way for women, not only in the field of science but the workforce in general, especially mothers. One of her more famous quotes addresses
      her work and family life balance, "I have frequently been questioned, especially by women, of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy." It may not have been easy but she was still able to raise two
      children, which in itself is a major accomplishment, but also acheived so much in the scientific field. As a mother myself trying to path a way for myself in IT I find her absolutley admirable. She seemed to be a humble, down to earth person who
      followed her passion regardless of societial norms. She raised two daughters, one of which went on to win a Nobel Prize herself and another who became a writer and wrote a biography about her mother. Marie was a beautiful example to her daughters and many others of how with passion and hard work anything can be done. As a mother with two daughters myself I can only hope that I am setting a good example for them that even as a woman in a primarly male occupation that with determination and hard work anything is possible.  Even now in the 21st century it is hard for women to get past that fact that they are to be at home cleaning house and raising the children, it's even harder when their passion falls into a field
      that is believed to be a man's occupation. Marie Curie is just one of many women that I believe have helped try to break that stigma and prove that women have just as much to offer academically as men.</p>
